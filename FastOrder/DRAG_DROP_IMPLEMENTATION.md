# Drag and Drop CSV Upload Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds drag and drop functionality to the existing FastOrder CSV upload feature while maintaining full compatibility with the current click-to-upload functionality.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. New JavaScript Module
**File:** `view/frontend/web/js/drag-drop-upload.js`
- Creates a Magento widget for drag and drop functionality
- Integrates with existing upload system
- Provides visual feedback during drag operations
- Validates file types (CSV only)
- Auto-initializes when the FastOrder container is present

### 2. Enhanced CSS Styling
**File:** `view/frontend/web/css/styles.css`
- Added visual styling for drag and drop zone
- Hover effects and transition animations
- Visual feedback when files are dragged over the area
- Error message styling
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- File upload icons and success feedback

### 3. RequireJS Configuration
**File:** `view/frontend/requirejs-config.js`
- Added the drag-drop-upload module to the configuration
- Ensures the module is properly loaded

### 4. Template Enhancement
**File:** `view/frontend/templates/fastorder/quickview.phtml`
- Added widget initialization via data-mage-init
- Added accept=".csv" attribute to file input for better browser filtering

## Features Implemented

### Drag and Drop Functionality
- **Drop Zone**: The entire FastOrder container acts as a drop zone
- **Visual Feedback**: Border changes color and shows overlay when dragging files
- **File Validation**: Only accepts CSV files
- **Error Handling**: Shows error messages for invalid files
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing upload functionality

### Visual Enhancements
- **Dashed Border**: Upload area now has a clear visual boundary
- **File Icon**: Shows folder icon in upload area
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive feedback on hover
- **Drag Over State**: Green highlight when dragging files over the area
- **Instructions**: Clear text showing "or drag and drop your CSV file here"

### User Experience
- **Dual Method Support**: Both click-to-upload and drag-and-drop work
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for better user experience
- **Error Feedback**: Clear error messages for invalid files

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The widget auto-initializes when the page loads
2. **Area Enhancement**: Waits for Vue.js to render the upload button, then enhances the area
3. **Event Handling**: Listens for drag and drop events on the container
4. **File Processing**: When a file is dropped:
   - Validates it's a CSV file
   - Sets it to the hidden file input
   - Triggers the existing upload process
5. **Visual Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback during all interactions

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting HTML5 drag and drop API
- Fallback to click-to-upload for older browsers
- File API support required for drag and drop

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Functionality
1. Navigate to the FastOrder page
2. Verify the upload area shows with dashed border and file icon
3. Test clicking "Choose File" button (existing functionality)
4. Test dragging a CSV file over the upload area
5. Verify visual feedback (border turns blue, then green when over the area)
6. Drop the CSV file and verify it uploads correctly

### Error Handling
1. Try dragging a non-CSV file (should show error message)
2. Try dragging multiple files (should only process the first one)
3. Verify error messages disappear after 3 seconds

### Responsive Design
1. Test on mobile devices
2. Verify the upload area scales appropriately
3. Check that drag and drop works on touch devices (where supported)

## Integration Notes
- The implementation preserves all existing functionality
- No changes to backend upload processing
- Works with the existing Vue.js application
- Compatible with Magento's widget system
- Maintains the current file validation and error handling

## Customization Options
The CSS classes can be easily customized:
- `.drag-drop-zone` - Main upload area styling
- `.drag-over` - Active drag state styling  
- `.drag-drop-instructions` - Instructional text styling
- `.drag-drop-error` - Error message styling
